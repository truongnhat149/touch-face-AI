* B1: Press the button "Train 1", then do a full half part recording on the person waiting for 5-7s for the camera to record your normal actions
* B2: Same as step 1: about rotation time and angle. Press the button "Train 2" In this 2nd time, you have to keep your hand on the screen (at least let the camera see your hand) then perform actions to touch your face or move your hand back and forth in front of the camera.
* B3: Press the button "run"
